    - figures
    - table captions
    - doi-uri in the header on page1 should be extracted to self uri and doi

- Grouping/sectioning
    - all empty p-elements, and p-elements with only whitespace should be deleted
    - change all p after h1 References to ref elements
    - if fn present in body that do not belong to table, move them to fn-group in back section
    - properly group into sec/title based on heading levels of h1-h6 elements

        p/table-wrap/(caption/title/p), table
        p/table-wrap/(label,caption/p), table
    - place article title, abstract, keywords, authors in the right place.
