Flat extract
    - figure odf extract not implemented
    - table captions not implemented, using placeholders
    - doi-uri in the header on page1 should be extracted to self uri and doi (specific to PP)
    - text-frames located in the document body and header and footer content should temporarily be placed
      in article/orphans/orphan[@origin="header|footer|body"]
        - Then during the grouping phase of the document, these orphans can be tested using regex pattern matching
          to see if there is any information there that should be in the article/front/article-meta section.
        - afterwords these orphans should be put in comment nodes, to allow the person running the JATS conversion to 
          decide what to do with it.
    - electronic journal type references with elocation and no pages: elocation-id extraction haven't been implemented

Grouping/sectioning
    - p-elements with only whitespace should be deleted
    - if tables are after h1 references, they should be in article/back/sec along with table labels and captions.
        - need to give paragraph styles to table label and caption to make sure they can be identified
        - see article by Angerer

Reference list parsing/autotagging
    - Dissertations - should they also be marked up using element-citation?

Citations in text parsing/autotagging
    - Done, but can be improved a little.
        - if only year is in parens, inspect the immediately preceding text node to extract
          capital letters to use in rid autogeneration for xref-elements

Notes about JATS tables, the following is allowed: 
    p/table-wrap/(caption/title, caption/p), table
    p/table-wrap/(label,caption/p), table
    table-wrap/caption
    table-wrap/table/(thead, tbody)
    table-wrap/table-wrap-foot
    table-wrap/table-wrap-foot/fn-group/fn+

    Tables can occur inside p elements, and can also occur directly within the body element or sec elements:
    app, app-group, bio, body, boxed-text, disp-quote, fig, floats-group, glossary, license-p, named-content, notes, 
    p, ref-list, sec, styled-content, supplementary-material, table-wrap-group.
  
    Of most interest to us are:
    body, fig, disp-quote, floats-group, glossary, p, sec, supplementary-material, table-wrap-group
