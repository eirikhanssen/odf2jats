Flat extract
    - figures
    - table captions
    - doi-uri in the header on page1 should be extracted to self uri and doi (specific to PP)

Grouping/sectioning
    - p-elements with only whitespace should be deleted
    - if tables are after h1 references, they should be in article/back/sec along with table labels and captions.
        - need to give paragraph styles to table label and caption to make sure they can be identified
        - see article by Angerer

Reference list parsing/autotagging

References in text parsing/autotagging
    - create unit tests with different text samples containing different types of text references
    - when developing reftext-parser, run against tests to see if they pass or fail.
    - Different types of citations in text:
        - Only year (single)
            - authors are listed in the last sentence before the parens
        - One author One year

Notes about JATS tables, the following is allowed: 
    p/table-wrap/(caption/title, caption/p), table
    p/table-wrap/(label,caption/p), table
    table-wrap/caption
    table-wrap/table/(thead, tbody)
    table-wrap/table-wrap-foot
    table-wrap/table-wrap-foot/fn-group/fn+

    Tables can occur inside p elements, and can also occur directly within the body element or sec elements:
    app, app-group, bio, body, boxed-text, disp-quote, fig, floats-group, glossary, license-p, named-content, notes, 
    p, ref-list, sec, styled-content, supplementary-material, table-wrap-group.
  
    Of most interest to us are:
    body, fig, disp-quote, floats-group, glossary, p, sec, supplementary-material, table-wrap-group
